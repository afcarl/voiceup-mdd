This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research data to respect your privacy. However, even with removal of this information, experts in re-identification may be able to reverse our processes and/or attempt to re-identify an individual given enough cross-reference information about him or her.</p> <p>- Accidental public disclosure may occur due to unintended data breaches including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study.

The investigators will not provide clinical care but you will be provided a list of resources.</p> <p>The treatment or procedure may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable.</p> <p>At the beginning of the survey, the application will remind you to go to a quiet, distraction-free location where you will be able to speak out loud.
